=======================
MVP - Maya Viewport API
=======================

I really needed this...

This module exists to unify and pythonify the various commands and apis necessary to manipulate Maya's 3D Viewports. These include, hardwareRenderGlobal attributes, modelPanel and modelEditor commands, as well as some key features of OpenMayaUI's M3dView class.

::

    from mvp import Viewport

    view = Viewport.active()
    view.camera = 'top'
    view.background = 0.5, 0.5, 0.5
    view.nurbsCurves = False


Features
========

* Unified api for manipulating Maya Viewports

* Get or set viewport state (all attributes). Making it easy to restore a Viewport to a previous configuration.

* Easily set focus and playblast Viewports. Much more consistent than using active view.

* Draw text in Viewports using QLabels.

* Show identifiers in viewports, making it easy to grab the correct viewport at a glance.
